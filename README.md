About Project
=============
This is a QR Code based inventory management System design for Jairaj Ancillaries Pvt Ltd.

The inventory of Jairaj was poorly managed with no data of outflow being recorded in the ERP and had less security. To solve these issues, a custom QR code based inventory management software was developed for Jairaj using visual fox pro.

The idea was that a QR code will be generated, printed and pasted on incoming stock using the software. The item will be placed at the location written on the sticker. Whenever a labor has to take something out of the inventory, he would simply scan the QR code in front of a USB camera.
